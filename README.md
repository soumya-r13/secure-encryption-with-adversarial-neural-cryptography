# secure-encryption-with-adversarial-neural-cryptography
Adversarial neural cryptography used to design a crypt analysis model where the neural models successfully communicate using encryption upto 256-bits message with an adversary present with 99.84% accuracy. 
secure encryption model with adversarial neural cryptography using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) neural models.
